# TerrainComponent
UE4 terrain component basic version

See my article for more info.

The component code is in `src/`

Don't forget to change `UNDERWATER_API` to your project's API in the `.h` file.

You need the [PerlinNoiseComponent](https://github.com/nialna/PerlinNoiseComponent) and [RuntimeMeshComponent](https://github.com/nialna/RuntimeMeshComponent) to use it.
